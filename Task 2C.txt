TASK – 2 C
Approaches used -	1- Breadth First Search (BFS)
			2- Depth First Search (DFS)

1.	Breadth First Search

Breadth First Search is a non-recursive algorithm that traverses a graph breadthwise.
All the visited nodes are added to a queue/list to mark them as visited and the next breadth is reached when a dead end is encountered.

BFS Implementation in task 2B :

Data Structures used for Implementation :
-	Frontier  : List
-	Wishlist : Queue.

Conditions to be satisfied :
- Size of Frontier and Wishlist together to be less than 1000
- depth atmost to be 5

		Step 1: Pass the seed to the crawl function. (seed acts as the root node).
			while (size of both Frontier and Wishlist < 1000) do – condition to be satisfied

		Step 2:   a)
			  If Wishlist is empty, make seed as the currenturl.
 			  Add it to the Frontier and also add a special character, in this case “#”

			  b)
			  Else if Wishlist is not empty, Remove the first element from Wishlist
			  And make it currenturl  

			  c)
			  If the currenturl already exists in the Frontier  then repeat case b.


               Step 3: A call is made to the crawl(), whiich performs the crawling of the given url

	       Step 4: The results of crawl() are added to the Wishlist after refining them based on the requirement.

	       Step 5: Goto Step 2.
		
	       The above mentioned steps are repeated until the conditions are no longer satisfied. 


2.	Depth First Search

Depth First Search is a non-recursive algorithm that traverses a graph depthwise.
All the visited nodes are added to a queue/list to mark them as visited and the next depth is reached whenever a node is visited provided that node has children.

DFS Implementation in task 2B :

Data Structures used for Implementation :
-	Frontier  : List

Conditions to be satisfied :
- Size of Frontier and Wishlist together to be less than 1000
- depth atmost to be 5

		Step 1:  Pass the seed url and the keyword to the crawl function. (seed acts as the root node).
			 while (size of both Frontier and Wishlist < 1000) do – condition to be satisfied

		Step 2:  seed url is added to the Frontier and Crawl() is performed on this url.
			 
               	Step 3:  The first child of the seed is added to the Frontier and passed to crawl().

       	        Step 4: The first node of every parent is added to the Frontier and is passed to crawl().
		
	        The above mentioned steps are repeated until either of the conditions are no longer satisfied. 

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

In Task 2 A, which is focused crawling using Breadth First Search algorithm,

		Pages Crawled - 8
		Links Retrived with "solar" - 1000

Thus to retrieve about 1000 links by satisfying both the conditions, BFS crawled 8 pages.


In Task 2 A, which is focused crawling using Breadth First Search algorithm,

		Pages Crawled - 236
		Links Retrived with "solar" - 236

Thus 236 links that contain the key word "solar" are retieved when 1000 unique urls were crawled 
by satisfying both the mentioned conditions.
