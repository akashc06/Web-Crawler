Steps for an efficient merging procedure for 2 independent runs

Step 1: Sort both the results alphabetically

Step 2: Compare the sorted list of URLs and check for duplicates and remove the duplicates if any.
	This step will reduce the redundancies that exist and thus will make the merging easier

Step 3: Now combine both the list and again sort alphabetically

Step 4: Pass this sorted list through a ranking algorithm that ranks the list depending on the user revies, popularity and credibility.

Step 5: The low ranked URLs are checked if they have a link to the Top ranked ones.
	If so remove the low ranked URLs.

Step 6: Now check if any URL points to another URL within the list, if so remove them.

Step 7: Pass the list again through the ranking algorithm.

Step 8: If the length is less than or equal to 1000, STOP.
	Else remove the low ranked URLs as they will have less popularity and low reviews.
